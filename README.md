# Testing with Selenium and Ruby

Selenium is one of the most popular tools for testing web-based applications. It allows QA engineers to write and automate tests across many different browsers and operating systems, without a special scripting language. This project introduces Selenium to new users, covering installation and basic use cases. Find out how to set up the test-writing framework, WebDriver, and Selenium Grid, which allows you to distribute the testing load and run tests against a remote server. Learn best practices to write effective tests using variables and functions, and to organize tests into suites that can scale over time.
